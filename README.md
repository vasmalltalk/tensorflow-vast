TensorFlow is a Google open source machine learning library for research and production. And this is a wrapper to be used from a higher level language like VASmalltalk.

## Supported platforms and versions
Currently we tested this wrapper on Linux and Windows, both on x86 and x64. In addition, we tested on ARM (Raspberry Pi 3B+ and Raspbian Buster) and ARM64 (Rock64 and Armbian Buster).

We have only tested on TensorFlow versions 1.13.x and 1.14.x.

## Installation

- Download the [latest ECAP from Instantiations](https://www.instantiations.com/ecap/).
- Install [TensorFlow for C](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c) for your operating system (download one of the tested versions).
- Ensure tensorflow shared library (`.so` or `.dll`) is findable by OS lookup procedure or reference full path in VAST ini file.
- Add `TENSORFLOW_LIB` key/value under `[PlatformLibrary Name Mappings]` section in `abt.ini` file. Some examples:
```
TENSORFLOW_LIB=tensorflow
TENSORFLOW_LIB=/usr/local/lib/libtensorflow_framework.so.1.14.0
TENSORFLOW_LIB=/home/mpeck/Instantiations/TensorFlow/libtensorflow-cpu-linux-x86_64-1.14.0/lib/libtensorflow.so.1.14.0
TENSORFLOW_LIB=c:\Users\mpeck\Documents\Instantiations\tensorflow.dll
TENSORFLOW_LIB=z:\Instantiations\TensorFlow\libtensorflow-cpu-windows-x86_64-1.13.1\lib\tensorflow.dll
```
- Clone this repository.
- From the configuration map browser, import all versions of the `TensorFlow` map from `envy/TensorFlow.dat`. Then "Load With Required Maps" the latest version of it.
- Run SUnit Suite for all `TensorFlow` map (right click on the map -> `Test Loaded Applications`). You should see around 260 unit tests and most of them passing.
- Explore the [documentation](docs/).


## Examples
We will be submitting more and more examples in `TensorFlowExamplesApp`. So far the only working example is `LabelImage` which loads a pre-trained TensorFlow network and use it to recognize objects in images. You can read its class comments for details, instructions and possible uses.

## Running TensorFlow and VASmalltalk on ARM

We believe that running TensorFlow and VASmalltalk on ARM-based boards is really interesting. From limited devices such as a Raspberry Pi to a Nvidia Jetson.

We have compiled TensorFlow C library for ARM and ARM 64 and have been playing with different operating systems and boards such as Raspberry Pi 3B+ (Raspbian), Rock64 (Armbian) and soon Nvidia Jetson Nano and XT2.  

Building TensorFlow from scratch on ARM is a bit complicated so we try to document this process on blog posts as we learn. For the moment, you can checkout these:
