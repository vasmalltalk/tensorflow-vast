TensorFlow is a Google open source machine learning library for research and production. And this is a wrapper to be used from a higher level language like VASmalltalk.

## Installation

- Download the [latest ECAP from Instantiations](https://www.instantiations.com/ecap/)
- Install [TensorFlow for C](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c)
- Ensure tensorflow shared library is in path or reference full path in VAST ini file
- Add ``[PlatformLibrary Name Mappings]`` entry in `abt.ini` file:
			TENSORFLOW_LIB=tensorflow
								or
			TENSORFLOW_LIB=/absolute/path/to/tensorflow
- Import and load the `TensorFlow` configuration map from `TensorFlow.dat`.
- Run SUnit Suite for all `TensorFlow` map.
- Explore the [documentation](docs/)


## Running TensorFlow and VASmalltalk on ARM

We believe that running TensorFlow and VASmalltalk on ARM-based boards is really interesting. From limited devices such as a Raspberry Pi to a Nvidia Jetson.

We have compiled TensorFlow C library for ARM and ARM 64 and have been playing with different operating systems and boards such as Raspberry Pi 3B+ (Raspbian), Rock64 (Armbian) and soon Nvidia Jetson Nano and XT2.  

Building TensorFlow from scratch on ARM is a bit complicated so we try to document this process on blog posts as we learn. For the moment, you can checkout these:
